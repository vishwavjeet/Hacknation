## About Project
Attendance is the daily routine of checking  absence or presence of students or employees in any school, college, university or organization respectively.

The existing method of attendance markup includes manual(Pen and Paper), biometric authentication based attendance record process.

Manual and biometrics based methods are time consuming and requires sophisticated hardware. Therefore, for solving these problems(like-proxy issues, financial burden for hardware installation),we can switch for an alternate attendance system based on android application to save time and resources.

Automated Attendance System has been envisioned for the purpose of reducing the errors that occur in the traditional (manual) attendance system. 









**Tech stack**:

 Tool and Frameworks used:
PC/Laptop and Android Smartphone
Android Studio (Java)
CameraX
ML Kit
TensorFlowÂ Lite
OpenCV/Image processing and Python
Google Maps API
SQL/Firebase as an internal database



## Use Cases of your project
We may provide our App as a service to the private & government sector organizations for use as an Attendance management system.

This project on Face recognition and Geo-fencing based attendance system will increase the convenience of attendance management.
